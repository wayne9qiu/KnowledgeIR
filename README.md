# KnowledgeIR
Knowledge graph based information retrieval

This is the repository I used to conduct my Ph.D. research and my other collaborations at CMU: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/Research.html.

It is open-sourced under the Lemur License:  http://www.lemurproject.org/license.html.

It uses Python 2.7 and PyTorch 0.xx versions.

The whole dependency is in the setup.py file.

12/26/2018: The current stage of this repository perhaps is more suitable for code re-use or as an example. 

More documentations coming...
